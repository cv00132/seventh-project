## Seventh Project -- w3d1
# CSS Transitions

* Assignment - * Build a jQuery Accordion WITHOUT using slideUp, slideDown, or slideToggle. Hint: use addClass & removeClass.
              * Only CSS3 transitions allowed. It should work for 2 or more sections.
              * Each paragraph in each section of the accordion should be a different length. It's important to learn how to deal with variable content length.
              * Use the image below as an example

1. CSS
  * Utilized transitions to enhance user experience
  * Employed `id` and `class` to identify individual elements for better directed styling
  * Using `overflow: hidden` I was able to hide text when not being called on

2. Javascript
  * Used jQuery to `addClass` to elements for use in CSS
  * Using the `click` function triggers the CSS transitions
